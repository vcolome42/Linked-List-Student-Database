# Linked-List-Student-Database
A database of students managed using linked lists, developed in C.

This project was created in my first year of undergrad for my Programming Practicum class, with a primary focus on understanding linked lists and memory management.

To use the program, simply follow these steps:

## STEP 1: Executing the program

- Ensure the folder containing the executable (named student_database.exe) is in the same folder as the file you plan to have the program read from. The program is designed to work exclusively with .csv files in both reading and writing, such as the .csv file included. The `small.csv` file contains a list of 10 students with the following identifying information: Full Name, Student ID Number, GPA, and Credit Hours Completed.

- Double-click on `student_database.exe` in the directory

- Upon executing the program, a command prompt window should appear

## STEP 2: Navigating the Program

- The program should prompt you for input on whether you would like to load the database from a file `F` or start with an empty database where you enter students' information manually `E`.
- Following this, you have several options available to you:
  1. Create a new student and add them to the database, `C`
  2. Read/Display your list to the console, `R`
  3. Export your desired list to a .csv file, `E`
  4. Delete a student from the database, `D`
  5. Exit the program, `X`
